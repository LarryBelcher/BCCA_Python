README for BCCA_Python Project

This project contains several scripts that have been developed to process CMIP5 BCCA
data. Im most cases, the original data have been produced by the various scripts in
Dave Blodgett's derivatives_runner repository (https://github.com/dblodgett-usgs/derivatives_runner)
This project will likely be ongoing and new scripts will be added as new data requests are made for 
the CRT.
